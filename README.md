GoreBlogBundle
==============

# Installation

## Installing the bundle
Add the following requirements to your composer.json :

```
"require": {
    ...
    "petegore/blog-bundle": "dev-master"
},
```

A Symfony2 blog bundle (work in progres)

This bundle is not complete : the blog misses a lot of functionalities, and many bug remain.

I put it in GitHub / Packagist in order to use & test it in parallele of the dev.
You can check the progress on my developper blog that I just initiated at the same time as the bundle : http://www.petegore.fr

I'll write a install procedure ASAP.

Thanks :)
